    <p class="p-1 px-2">
        Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps) are a visual method used to simplify Boolean algebra expressions.
        <br>
        They help to minimise the number of logic gates needed in a digital circuit by grouping together adjacent cells that represent TRUE outputs.
        <br>
        Importantly, K-Maps can only be used for functions with up to four or five variables effectively. This will not matter for exam questions as 
        they will only use up to four variables.
        <br>
        When it comes to plotting K-Maps, remember the following rules:
        <br>
        1. Each cell represents a minterm (a unique combination of variable states that results in a TRUE output).
        <br>
        2. Groups must contain 2, 4, 8 or 16 cells (powers of two) and should be as large as possible to maximise simplification.
        <br>
        3. Groups can wrap around the edges of the K-Map.
        <br>
        4. Each group should be marked to indicate which variables remain constant within that group.
        <br>
        By following these rules, you can effectively use Karnaugh Maps to simplify Boolean expressions and design efficient digital circuits.
